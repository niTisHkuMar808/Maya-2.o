 Verse 1:
I'm fiber, strong and fine
Weaving through networks, connecting all the time
Carrying data, near and far
Making sure information gets to where it is

Chorus:
Fiber, oh fiber
Connecting the world, one strand at a time
Fiber, oh fiber
Making sure the world stays online

Verse 2:
I'm in cables, under the sea
Ensuring global communication can be
From New York to Paris, and back again
Fiber, the world's information highway

Chorus:
Fiber, oh fiber
Connecting the world, one strand at a time
Fiber, oh fiber
Making sure the world stays online

Bridge:
I'm the backbone of the digital age
The silent hero, working on the stage
I may not be seen, but I'm always there
Fiber, the world's unsung hero, beyond compare

Chorus:
Fiber, oh fiber
Connecting the world, one strand at a time
Fiber, oh fiber
Making sure the world stays online

Outro:
Fiber, oh fiber
Strong and resilient, through every storm
Fiber, oh fiber
The world's information highway, forever warm.
