As a content writer, I can assist you with typing a bibliography. Please provide me with the details of the bibliography you need, such as:

1. The citation style (e.g. MLA, APA, Chicago, Harvard)
2. The number of sources you need to cite
3. The type of sources (e.g. books, articles, websites, journals)
4. Any specific formatting or organization requirements

Here is an example of a bibliography in MLA format:

**Book:**

Lastname, Firstname. Title of Book. City: Publisher, Year of Publication. Print.

Example:
Smith, John. The History of Computers. New York: Random House, 2010. Print.

**Journal Article:**

Lastname, Firstname. "Title of Article." Title of Journal Volume, Issue (Year of Publication): Page Numbers. Print.

Example:
Johnson, Mary. "The Impact of Social Media on Society." Journal of Communication Studies 20, no. 3 (2015): 12-20. Print.

**Website:**

Lastname, Firstname. "Title of Website." Title of Website, Date of Publication, URL. Accessed Date of Access.
